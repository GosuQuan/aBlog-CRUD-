# Envers

I finally could be a project from front end to backend!!!
for about 4 days to get there. From learning the express structure. Which is definitely a nightmare when everything  gets started.Facing with any bugs and tried for longtime.
Now can call myself a full-stack sofeware Engineer

learing from 0 - 1 gives me lots of confidence 
and trustworthy and that's why I get started to the this depth.

make a propose and find a problem and fixed it. 
Don't be afraid to make mistakes There would be some tips for success.

# CNvers

做出第一个前后端项目，链接数据库，终于也可以叫自己是小小全栈工程师了
开始的过程是无比枯燥和噩梦的。我花了大概五天时间学习和掌握了express.js这个框架并开发出一个具有查询，删除，新增和更新功能的基于markdown的博客,node.js是非常常用的一个东西，里面npm有非常多的库。

安装：默认端口在本地服务器的 : 5000

启动: 在终端（cmd）文件根目录下运行"npm run start",可以自行修改
package.json文件。

注意:博客标题暂时不能填写中文，(应该说是只能用英语):因为运用的slugify和其对应的slug参数绑定，如用中文会导致url无法解析报错。
